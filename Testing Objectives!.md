Test Release 2.0 Testing Goals:
-----------------------------------
* This is a hopeful release candidate if things go well, so try to break things! If you find an bug that isn't listed in known issues, please create an issue/PM me on reddit, and include a screenshot if possible!

* Non-Tasker folks: This update should make things a hell of a lot easier for you, as I reworked every unlock-based animation in this thing to support changing between tasker and non-tasker functionality at the flick of a switch. If it still doesn't work, please let me know. And if it does work, still let me know. I wanna know things.

* Please let me know what you think of the new sounds! I'm open to suggestions for improvements and additions, just keep in mind that there's only so much that tasker can do when it comes to KLWP and sounds.

* I ended up with more free space left in the theme then I expected, so I wanna hear what you guys think I should add. Gimme the one thing that you would add to this theme if you could, and I'll see what I can do about including the ones I like.
